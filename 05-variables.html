      // if you remove the semi colon from the line above then the code wont work.

      // the value 3 the value only changes when a value is reassigned.

      // it causes an error to create two variables with the same name.

      // var is the original way to create variables
      // it tends not to be used because of issues 
      // you may see it in later code.
      // you can use typeof with variables this is very useful
