// if the arrow function is only one line you can remove the parenthases as well as the

// when an arrow function only has one param the brackets are optional and can be removed
// as you can see above

  //for each is a way to loop through an array you can see the function
  // has been replaced with an arrow here. 
  // when we are passing a function into another function
  // like for each it is recommended to use arrow functions
  // as it makes the code easier to read.

  /*Closure */

  
  // if a function has access to a value it will always have access to that value
  // the value gets packaged together (enclosed).
  // closures naturally happens in javascript code once a function is no longer 
  // closures arent used that often. 

  // functions are values
  // set timeout set interval - run a function in the future. 
  //  we learned an array method called .forEach - cleaner way of looping through an array
//  as an alternative to a for loop. 
//  we learned about arrow functions and .addEventListener and .removeEventListener 
// which replaces onclick and has advantages over onClick. 
// We also learned filter (creates a new array with values filtered out)
// and map(maps values to a new array after some change to the values)*2
// and closures in fucntions
// To use a closure, define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.

// The inner function will have access to the variables 
// in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.
