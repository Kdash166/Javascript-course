    <!-- built in objects are object that
    exist in JS such as console math 
JSON etc the DOM is just another example 
of a built in object -->

    <script>

// document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';
// document is an object the dot notation means we are
// accessing a property of that object. called body. 
// body is also an object so we can access.innerHTML
//  when we make the innerHTML = to 'hello'
// the body is replaced with hello so the DOM is linked
// to the page in a special way.
// document.title = 'good job!'
// changes the title property on the tabs.
// the document object is linked to the webpage
// the document object models the web page 
// hense the name document object model. 
//  the dom works the same way as any othe object
// the DOM has properties like body and title that 
// are accessed using .notation like any other object.
//  however the DOM is special as changing properties here. 
// allows you to change propeties directly on the webpage.
// the DOM also has methods not just properties.
// eg .querySelector.

/*console.log(document.title);
document.title = 'changed';
// this changes the title.
console.log(document.body);
// an important feature of JS is html can exist in html. 
// the DOM combinds html and JS and together alowing JS to control html
console.log(typeof document.body);
// this tells us the html element is just an object when inside of javascript
// body also has useful html methods and properties
console.log(document.body.innerHTML);
document.body.innerHTML = '<button style="border-radius:8px;color:white;background-color:black;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:3rem;"onclick="alert(`you know JS good`)">Good-Job</button>' ;
*/
// inner html gives us control of all the html inside the body.
// you can see in the above code we placed a button with inline js and css into the body
console.log(document.querySelector('button').innerHTML);
document.querySelector('button')
    .innerHTML ="good bye";
    // you can put the dot notation on a second line 
// just tab it to make it easier to read.
console.log(document.querySelector('.js-clickme'));
// the above console log can be stored into a variable.
const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.js-clickme');
console.log(buttonElement);
// when we start with a dot this is called a class selector
// this is also used in CSS infact anything can be used here that is 
// used in CSS.
// we use this to style elements with a spercific class. 
// common practice is to start the class with js-
console.log(document.querySelector('#hello-world'));

// document.quertyselector with a '.js-clickme' selects a class 
// with a # you select the ID.

// this targets the text and changes it 
// this is a method that lets us get any element
// from the page and put it inside our javascript. 
//the string tells us which element it will get. 
// you can use the string body p and it will find and 
// get the first object. 
// every html element lets us control its html 
// by using .innerHTML.
// you can take html elements and save them as a variable
// the dom basically allows you to combined html and JS 
// together allowing you to fully manipulate the page.
